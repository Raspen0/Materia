Materia
=======

My first mod which I use to learn Java

The idea for this mod is that you'll be able to infuse items to give them more abilitys
There will also be machines in this mod, so this mod is going to be both Tech and Magic

I'm verry bad at texturing so most of the textures are recolors of minecraft textures
If someone wants to make a texture for this mod, you can find the current textures in src/main/java/assets

If you made a texture for this mod. please make a Pull Request or make a Issue and put a imgur link to it in there.
